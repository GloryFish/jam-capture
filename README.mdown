# jam capture

A simple time-lapse screen capture script for OSX.

This was created for me to use during game jams, you may find it useful, enjoy!

## usage

Run capture.py when you want to record your screen. Ctrl-C when you want to stop. As long as you leave the captured images in the images folder capture.py will pick up where it left off.

Run encode.sh to combine the images into a .mov video file using ffmpeg.

## requirements

- OSX
- ffmpeg for encoding
